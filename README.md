# LexAnalyzer
  We are designing a lexical analyzer that will generate tokens from the given input in a high level language statement. We have not used any database for storing the symbol table used in this project as such, as parsing the entire statement is beyond the scope of this project. This makes our lexical analyzer portable and independent of a DBMS. This although reduces the number of keywords and special characters identifiable by the lexical analyzer, and increases the length of the code, but on the other hand reduces the program complexity and increases the overall speed of the system.
 The main features of this lexical analyzer can be summarized as: -
 • Simple implementation.  
• Fast lexical analysis.
 • Efficient resource utilization.
 • Portable
